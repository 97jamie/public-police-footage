# public-police-footage

This repository is for the paper Constructing Datasets From Public Police Body Camera Footage by Jamie Rosas-Smith, Martijn Bartelds, Ruizhe Huang, Leibny Paola Garc√≠a-Perera, Karen Livescu, Dan Jurafsky, and Anjalie Field. It includes code for downloading and processing public police body-worn camera footage from YouTube. The resulting data is ready for training and fine-tuning of off-the-shelf ASR models, and we provide code for fine-tuning Whisper using our dataset.

## Requirements and Installation
Create a conda environment and install the packages in config/requirements.txt:
```
conda create -n police python=3.9 -y
conda activate police
pip install -r ./config/requirements.txt
```


## Downloading videos - base dataset
1. First, download the videos. You will need to pass a cookie file to the download script (see below "How to pass YouTube cookies"). Then, use the script yt-dlp.sh with a file list from the config directory to download videos:
```
# Download the hand-cleaned videos
./yt-dlp.sh config/batch_hand.txt

# Download the automatically cleaned videos
./yt-dlp.sh config/batch.txt

```
Outputs can then be found in the `output` folder

2. Run OCR to extract captions. This can be done with the python script ocr.py. The script takes as arguments the top-level directory containing video files (`--video_dir`), the directory containing json annotation files (`--anno_dir`, default = `annotations`), a directory to store outputs (`--output_dir`), where the outputs will preserve the directory structure of the video files. The script also takes a flag (`--hand`), which indicates if you are processing hand-corrected files and should take frame_start and frame_end times.

```
# Extract captions from the hand-cleaned videos
python ocr.py --video_dir output/batch_hand --hand --anno_dir annotations --output_dir output/batch_hand

# Extract captions from the automatically cleaned videos
python ocr.py --video_dir output/batch --anno_dir annotations --output_dir output/batch
```

3. [Optional] extract segments from audio
4. [Optional] explore and validate results

## Downloading videos - custom data
1. Navigate to your `police-data/config` directory.
2. Open `batch.txt`.
3. To download both the base dataset and custom data, simply append any new links to public YouTube playlists or videos. If you only want to download custom data, delete the existing links and enter your own. Enter each link on a separate line.
4. Run:
``` ./yt-dlp.sh
```

## Running OCR - base dataset
1. Run:
```python ocr.py
```
2. Output can be found under `output/ocr-[date-time]`

## Running OCR - custom data
### CPU
1. To speed up the OCR and only run the OCR on body-worn camera footage, you may include a JSON annotation file for each video. The name of the annotations file should match the name of the video file (e.g. `video123.mp4` should be named `video123.json`). Your annotation files must follow the same structure of the provided JSON files under `annotations-json`.
2. Run:
```python ocr.py --video_dir path_to_videos --anno_dir path_to_custom_annotations
```
3. Output can be found under `output/ocr-[date-time]`

### GPU

## Segmenting the audio
1. Run:
```python conversion.py path_to_videos path_to_annotations
```
2. Output can be found under `output/segments-[date-time]`

## Dataset validation

### How to pass YouTube cookies to yt-dlp:

1. Download the [Get cookies.txt Clean](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-clean/ahmnmhfbokciafffnknlekllgcnafnie?pli=1) Chrome extension.
2. Log in to the YouTube account you want to use to download.
3. Navigate to any page on YouTube.
4. Click the **Get cookies.txt** extension icon in your toolbar and a dialog will appear showing the list of cookies for the current page.
5. Click "Export As".
6. Navigate to your `police-data/config` directory.
7. Save cookies as `cookies.txt`.
